# langchain-semantic-search-engine

A hands-on project to build a semantic search engine using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), demonstrating document loading, text chunking, embeddings, and vector-based retrieval for intelligent document search.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a practical, step-by-step implementation of a semantic search engine leveraging LangChain and vector databases. The goal is to help you understand and experiment with:

- Loading and processing documents
- Generating text embeddings
- Storing and searching vectors
- Retrieving relevant information using natural language queries

## 🛠️ Features

- **Document Loading**: Easily ingest text from various sources  
- **Text Chunking**: Split large documents into manageable pieces  
- **Embeddings**: Convert text into vector representations with state-of-the-art models  
- **Vector Store**: Store and index embeddings for efficient similarity search  
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Find relevant documents using natural language queries
