This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.\n",

    "### Retrievers\n",
    "LangChain VectorStore objects do not subclass Runnable. LangChain Retrievers are Runnables, so they implement a standard set of methods (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous invoke and batch operations). Although we can construct retrievers from vector stores, retrievers can interface with non-vector store sources of data, as well (such as external APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a simple version of this ourselves, without subclassing Retriever. If we choose what method we wish to use to retrieve documents, we can create a runnable easily. Below we will build one around the similarity_search method:"
